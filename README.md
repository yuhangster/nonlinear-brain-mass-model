# Nonlinear Brain Mass Model

## Overview
This project represents an interdisciplinary collaboration between engineering and neuroscience, exploring how transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) modulates human attention. Our focus was on the neural mass model's influence on spatial auditory attention in the human parietal lobe.

## Background
Inspired by Jansen Rit's foundational work (1995), we hypothesized that the brain mass model could be characterized as a sparse system. Utilizing the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) algorithm, the project aimed to identify specific EEG patterns that respond to input signals.

## Contribution
A significant aspect of this project involved decoding interactions between two neural columns, leading to simulations of EEG responses to varied input signals. This analysis was crucial in understanding the modulation of parietal alpha during tACS and its impact on human attention.

## Applications
The research has potential therapeutic applications, including correcting EEG abnormalities seen in conditions like migraines. This is achieved through tailored input signals, offering innovative approaches in neuroscience therapeutics.

## Project Status
While the project concluded earlier than planned due to a shift in academic focus by one of the team members, it has provided valuable insights into the neural system, the cerebral cortex, and the application of nonlinear dynamic systems in neuroscience.

## Future Directions
The project's findings open avenues for further research in EEG pattern modulation and its therapeutic implications, aligning with broader goals of advancing neuroscience interventions.
